	<p>We are a group of students in Rutgers who are interested in <span class="red">Computer Science</span>. Some of us are <span class="red">women</span>, and some of us are <span class="red">men</span>. What unites us is our extraordinary delight for the growing number of women in computer science fields.</p>
